## Documentation.
Documentations are hosted on [ReadTheDocs](http://codeigniter-skeleton.readthedocs.io/).

## How does it cost?
I was not really going to share this at all! I built if for my own personal use, then I was told to sell it.
Well, I am not selling it, I am releasing it for free, but your donations are most welcome if you want to. You can send any amount you want to help me keep this project up and enhance it as much as I can.
