Don't forget to contribute if you please! If you have any suggestions, let me know and please, don't forget that I am human, I am not perfect, I DO mistakes, lots of mistakes! So if you find any issues, just let me know and feel free to suggest any changes and enhancements.

## Documentation.
Documentations are hosted on [ReadTheDocs](http://codeigniter-skeleton.readthedocs.io/).

## How does it cost?
I was not really going to share this at all! I built if for my own personal use, then I was told to sell it.
Well, I am not selling it, I am releasing it for free, but your donations are most welcome if you want to. You can send any amount you want to help me keep this project up and enhance it as much as I can.

## Documentation
You can find some documentations inside the **docs** folder. They are not complete but more to come later.

## Donate
Coding is not my main source of incomes, but it does help me pay bills and feed my family. Except for some client's projects, I earn **$0.00** a month from coding. So as I said earlier, you donations are most welcome.
